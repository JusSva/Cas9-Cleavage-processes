# Cas9-Cleavage-processes

This is a repository of a single jupyter notebook, which was written while working at Jones! lab using python 3. This notebook was used to visualize the impact that insertions in particular (although mimsmatches and deletions could also be used) have on Cas9 cleavage rate, position and kinetics. It is in no way, shape or form a perfect finished code, it still requires work so that it could be used by just importing it into another notebook.
In the future, I hope to make the functions in this notebook in such a way, as to be able to get outputs from them, by just using function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...) instead of having to find function_name and make quite a few changes between def function_name: and return variable.
