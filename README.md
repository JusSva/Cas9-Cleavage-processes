# Cas9-Cleavage-processes

This is a repository of a single jupyter notebook, which was written while working at Jones! lab using python 3. This notebook was used to visualize the impact that insertions in particular (although the framework for mimsmatches and deletions is also made in here) have on Cas9 cleavage rate, position and kinetics. It is in no way, shape or form a perfect finished code, it still requires work so that it could be used by just importing it into another notebook, but it is functional, minus one single logical error that was found.
In the future, I hope to make the functions in this notebook in such a way, as to be able to get outputs from them, by just using function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...) instead of having to find function_name and make quite a few changes between def function_name: and return variable such as changing the axis limits that are being displayed and so on.
